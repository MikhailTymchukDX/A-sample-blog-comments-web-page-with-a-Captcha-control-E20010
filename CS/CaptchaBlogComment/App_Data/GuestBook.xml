    <body>@Henrik,

I don't believe the initial release will contain an input timing feature but you can create a suggestion once the ASPxCaptcha is released and we'll consider it for a future release. Thanks!

    <body>Looking forward to go Captcha :)

Will the ASPxCaptcha control make use of timing-algorithm to determine if the input was performed by a human or a computer.  A human won't be able to enter a captcha in less than e.g. X seconds whereas a computer will do it in zero seconds.   It would be great if you also will implement this!
